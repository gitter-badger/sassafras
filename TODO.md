### Tasks

* **Todo**
    * [] Add JS minifying functionality
    * [] Live Reload
    * [] Console logging errors into a error.log

* []  **Consolidate into sassafras.js**
  * The ultimate goal of the project is to create one universal script to consolidate all of the functions of the tool into one universal JavaScript file. By the time of a 1.0 release, sassafras will have moved off of grunt's foundation and be built upon one of its own.

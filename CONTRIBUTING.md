# Contributing  
If you would like to contribute to sassafras, take a look at the guidelines below and start sending in your code!

### Contributors License Agreement  
Most forms of code contribution aside from supporting/fixing other user's requests requires that you sign and submit a [Contributors License Agreement](http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla) (CLA) with the Dojo Foundation.  
In summary, the CLA asserts that when you donate fixes or documentation, you both own the code that you're submitting and that the Dojo Foundation can in turn license that code to other people.  
Sending in a CLA is a one-time thing, and once it's done, you're in the clear to start contributing to all Dojo Foundation projects! To be effective, though, you need to know a little bit about how contributors and Committers coordinate their work, so getting involved and asking questions should be your first step.  
For more on CLAs, read Alex Russell's [Why Do I Need to Sign This?](http://infrequently.org/2008/06/why-do-i-need-to-sign-this/)

### Want to contribute?  
If you want to contribute to the project, but are unsure of where to start, this is the section for you! Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/tylerreckart/sassafras/issues) page to open or contribute to any active issues. If you resolve the issue, close it and mark it with **needs PR** (needs pull request), and I'll be sure to commit it into the project. Oh, and if you're working on an issue, be sure to leave a comment to let me know that you are working on it.  

## Non-code contributions  
If you aren't up to writing code, you can still contribute to and support the project!
  * You may submit updates and improvements to the [documentation](http://github.com/tylerreckart/sassafras/)

### Filing issues  
If something isn't working like it should, please read the [documentation](http://sassafras.io/docs); and if you haven't already, read the [getting started guide](http://sassafras.io/getting_started) 

If you have a question not covered in the documentation or want to report a bug, the best way to ensure it gets addressed is to file it in the appropriate issues tracker.
  * If there is an issue with sassafras
    * File an issue on the [main issues tracker](https://github.com/tylerreckart/sassafras/issues)
  * If there is an issue with the [website](http://sassafras.io)
    * File an issue on the [sassafras.io issue tracker](https://github.com/tylerreckart/sassafras.io/issues)

### Simplify the issue  
Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue. This makes it much easier (and much faster) to isolate and fix the issue.

### Explain the issue  
If I can't reproduce the issue, I can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue. Include versions of your OS, Node.js, dependencies, etc. Include relevant logs or sample code.
